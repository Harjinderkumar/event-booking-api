THE USER MUST BE AUTHENTICATED
 Users can Manage Events (create, update, delete and list(pagination/filtering)  )  - EVENT
 User can register and manage event attendees infomation    - ATTENDEES 
 User can book an event (prevent overbooking & duplicate booking)

 Attendees should be able to register without authentication. 
 Locations should be country-based rather than specific addresses. 

 Consider capacity limitations when booking an event. 
 The API should return structured, meaningful responses.
